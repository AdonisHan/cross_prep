# 1 raw data like this

# 2 boxplot raughly



# 4 using min-max scale


	- Min-Max Scaling values are in 0(min)~ 1(max) if all data are minimum, it set as 0. in this result, I decided not to using max-max scale
# 5 Z-score scaling 



	• Z-score scalings values only print within -1 ~ 1. It found as useful

# 5-2 qqplot by z-score scaling

# 6 another trying of decimal scaling
Max(|v'|)<1
